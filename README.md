## Gas Detection System Using Arduino and MQ-2 Sensor

This project aims to develop a gas detection system using an Arduino board and an MQ-2 gas sensor. The system is capable of detecting various harmful gases and providing visual and audible alerts based on the gas concentration levels.

## Features

- Detects various gases, including LPG, propane, methane, and smoke
- Provides visual alerts using LEDs (e.g., green for safe levels,  and red for high levels)
- Generates audible alerts using a buzzer for high gas concentration levels
- Displays gas concentration readings on serial monitor

## Requirements

- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno, Nano, Mega)
- MQ-2 gas sensor
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires
- LEDs (red, green)
- Buzzer

## Installation

1. download the source code.
2. Open the project in the Arduino IDE.
3. Connect the hardware components according to the circuit diagram provided.
4. Upload the code to your Arduino board.

## Usage

Once the code is uploaded and the hardware is set up correctly, the gas detection system will start monitoring the gas concentration levels. The LEDs and buzzer will indicate the current gas levels:

- Green LED: Safe gas levels
- Red LED and buzzer: High gas levels (potentially dangerous)

You can monitor the gas concentration readings via the serial monitor in the Arduino IDE.
